Project of the Universety of Stuttgart in subject "Data-Integrated Simulation Science A"
Based on https://github.com/daniel-haeufle/macroscopic-muscle-model and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021929014001018. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The model consists of the simulink model ''main.slx'', and requires the libraries **simscape multibody** and **simscape multibody contact forces library**. 

The model can be initilized by running of the ''init_main.m'', or by pushing the button ''Initilize me!'' in the model. 

TO FIX: the humanoid moves without external foorces due to muscles dynamics.
